# cse264-beatthebox
Game called Beat the Box by Jacob Herman, Bridget Hartman, and Anders Seline for CSE 264

Game Instructions:
Beat the box is a card game that can be played by single or multiple players. The objective of the game is to place all cards in the deck within a grid of 3x3 face-up cards on a table. The player will chose a card on the table, be if the next card drawn will be higher or lower, and then place the card down. If the bett is correct, the card replaces the one beneath it. If wrong, that stack of cards is flipped over and out of the game. The game continues until all cards are drawn, or all nine stacks on the table are flipped over (9 bad bets occur).
